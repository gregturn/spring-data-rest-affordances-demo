. Run the app
. In a separate window, `curl -v localhost:8080/employees` and observe existing employees (`/employees/1` and `/employees/2`).
. Create new entity at id=10 by typing `curl -v -X PUT localhost:8080/employees/10 -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"name":"Greg","role":"sw dev"}'`
. Observe that newly created entity is at `/employees/4` NOT `/employees/10`.
